Here is all the Markdown syntax we currently support:

## Headings

```md
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
#### This is a Heading 4
##### This is a Heading 5
###### This is a Heading 6
```

# This is a Heading 1

## This is a Heading 2

### This is a Heading 3

#### This is a Heading 4

##### This is a Heading 5

###### This is a Heading 6

## Formatting

### Emphasis

```md
*This text will be italic*

_This will also be italic_
```

*This text will be italic*

_This will also be italic_

```md
**This text will be bold**

__This will also be bold__
```

**This text will be bold**

__This will also be bold__

```md
_You **can** combine them_
```

_You **can** combine them_

### Strikethrough

```md
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
```

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

## Lists

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
  1. Item 3a
  2. Item 3b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    1. Item 3a
    2. Item 3b

## Links

```md
[This is what the link text will say](https://sibr.dev)
```

[This is what the link text will say](https://sibr.dev)

## Images

Below is the image syntax. It's like the link syntax, but with an exclamation point in front of it. Note that the link always starts with `/blog/` and then the name of the article (in this case `example-post`), followed by the image name. This is where our images will always be located on the actual blog, although it isn't where they're located in the github repo.

```md
![Alt text for your image goes here](/blog/example-post/image.png)
```

![A meme showing a whiteboard labeled "Days without the German office of information security contacting SIBR about telnet". Sibr writes below it, "0".](/blog/example-post/image.png)

## Blockquotes

```md
> This is a blockquote
```

> This is a blockquote

## Inline Code

```md
Text inside the `backticks` on a line will be formatted as code.
```

Text inside the `backticks` on a line will be formatted as code.

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is applied for the language following the opening backticks. We use Shiki for syntax highlighting, a list of supported languages can be found [at their documentation](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md)

<pre><code>
```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
</code></pre>

```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```md
First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

---

```md
Tables can be justified with a colon | Another example with a long title
:----------------|-------------:
because of the `:` | these will be justified
```

Tables can be justified with a colon | Another example with a long title
:----------------|-------------:
because of the `:` | these will be justified

---

```md
You can also include | Different kinds of styling | Inside table elements
:----------------|:-------------:|----------------:
for example | *this is italics* | **and this is bold**
[you can include links](https://sibr.dev)| `inline code` | $\textrm{and latex}$
```

## Horizontal Divider

```md
Use three stars ***, minuses ---, or underscores ___ in a new line to produce an horizontal bar.
```

---

### Footnote

```md
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: meaningful!

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
```

## Math

```md
$$

\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc

$$
```

$$

\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc

$$

```md
You can also do inline math like $e^{2i\pi} = 1$ .
```

You can also do inline math like $e^{2i\pi} = 1$ .

We use [Katex](https://katex.org). You can check what functions are supported in Katex [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

## HTML

Since Markdown is just a subset of HTML, we support all html tags, which you can use to get really specific with how things look, although we'd recommend reaching out to us to see if there's a better way to do it.

```css
<p style="color: purple;"> Custom CSS </p>
```

<p style="color: purple;"> Custom CSS </p>


## Imports

We also support [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows us to import components into our markdown files. This means you could make a custom component that includes some degree of interactivity, or way of conveying your data that doesn't involve using an image, and we absolutely can support that.

```mdx
import Callout from '@components/Callout.astro';

<Callout title="Callout">
  This is a callout!
</Callout>
```

import Callout from '@components/Callout.astro';

<Callout title="Callout">
  This is a callout!
</Callout>

Anyways, I guess that's all we have at the moment. So, ciao for now, and see you next time we update this page!
